# ChatGPT Clone Project

## Introduction

Welcome to my ChatGPT Clone Project! This project aims to replicate the functionality of a chatbot powered by GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) technology. Through this project, I demonstrate proficiency in both frontend and backend development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and API integration.

## Features

- **Chat Interface**: User-friendly chat interface allowing users to interact with the chatbot.
- **Real-time Responses**: Instantaneous responses from the chatbot, simulating a natural conversation.
- **Customization Options**: Options for customizing the chatbot's behaviour and appearance.
- **Server-side Functionality**: Utilizes Node.js and Express for server-side logic and handling API requests.
- **API Integration**: Integrates with the GPT API to generate responses based on user input.
